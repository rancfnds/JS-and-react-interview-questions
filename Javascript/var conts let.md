### Use Cases for `let`, `const`, and `var`

JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`. Each has different characteristics and use cases. Understanding when to use each can help you write more predictable and maintainable code.

### `var`

**Characteristics:**
- **Function Scope**: Variables declared with `var` are scoped to the function in which they are declared.
- **Hoisting**: `var` declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, meaning they are available before their declaration in the code, but their values are not hoisted.
- **Can be Re-declared**: Variables declared with `var` can be re-declared within the same scope without causing an error.

**Use Cases:**
- **Legacy Code**: Use `var` when working with older codebases where `var` is already extensively used.
- **Function Scope Required**: When you need a variable to be scoped to the function rather than the block.

**Example:**
```javascript
function example() {
  var x = 1;
  if (true) {
    var x = 2; // Same variable, not block-scoped
    console.log(x); // 2
  }
  console.log(x); // 2
}
example();
```

### `let`

**Characteristics:**
- **Block Scope**: Variables declared with `let` are scoped to the block in which they are declared (e.g., inside a `{}` block).
- **Hoisting**: `let` declarations are hoisted to the top of their block, but are not initialized. Accessing them before their declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.
- **Cannot be Re-declared**: Variables declared with `let` cannot be re-declared within the same block scope.

**Use Cases:**
- **Block Scope Required**: When you need a variable to be limited to the block scope, such as within loops or conditional statements.
- **Temporary Variables**: For variables that only need to exist temporarily within a block.

**Example:**
```javascript
function example() {
  let x = 1;
  if (true) {
    let x = 2; // Different variable, block-scoped
    console.log(x); // 2
  }
  console.log(x); // 1
}
example();
```

### `const`

**Characteristics:**
- **Block Scope**: Like `let`, variables declared with `const` are block-scoped.
- **Hoisting**: `const` declarations are hoisted to the top of their block, but are not initialized. Accessing them before their declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.
- **Cannot be Re-declared**: Variables declared with `const` cannot be re-declared within the same block scope.
- **Immutable Binding**: The binding (variable reference) is constant, meaning you cannot reassign the variable itself, but the value it holds can still be mutable if it's an object or array.

**Use Cases:**
- **Constants**: For values that should not be reassigned after their initial assignment.
- **Immutable References**: When you want to ensure the variable reference itself cannot be changed.

**Example:**
```javascript
function example() {
  const x = 1;
  if (true) {
    const x = 2; // Different variable, block-scoped
    console.log(x); // 2
  }
  console.log(x); // 1

  const arr = [1, 2, 3];
  arr.push(4); // Allowed, modifying the content of the array
  console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

  // arr = [4, 5, 6]; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
}
example();
```

### Summary

- **`var`**:
  - Function scoped
  - Hoisted with value `undefined`
  - Can be re-declared within the same scope
  - Use for legacy code or function-scoped variables

- **`let`**:
  - Block scoped
  - Hoisted without initialization
  - Cannot be re-declared within the same block
  - Use for block-scoped variables and temporary values

- **`const`**:
  - Block scoped
  - Hoisted without initialization
  - Cannot be re-declared within the same block
  - Immutable binding
  - Use for constants and immutable references

Choosing the right declaration keyword helps ensure your code behaves as expected and reduces bugs related to variable scope and reassignments.
