**Async** functions and **await** expressions are features introduced in ES8 (ES2017) to simplify writing asynchronous code in JavaScript. They build upon Promises and provide a more readable and synchronous-like way to handle asynchronous operations.

### Async Functions

An **async function** is a function that operates asynchronously via the event loop, using the `async` keyword before the function declaration. It allows you to write asynchronous code as if it were synchronous, without blocking the execution thread.

### Example of Async Function

```javascript
// Example of an async function
async function fetchData() {
  // Simulate an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from an API)
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json(); // Await the response JSON parsing
  return data; // Return the fetched data
}

// Using async function with await
async function process() {
  try {
    const result = await fetchData(); // Await the async function call
    console.log('Data fetched:', result);
    // Further processing with fetched data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}

process(); // Call the async function
```

### How Async Functions Work

- **Async Keyword**: Declares the function as asynchronous, allowing it to use the `await` keyword inside.
- **Await Expression**: Pauses the execution of the async function until the Promise is resolved, and then resumes with the resolved value.
- **Return Value**: Async functions always return a Promise, which resolves with the value returned by the function or rejects with an error thrown inside the function.

### Benefits of Async Functions and Await

1. **Readability**: Async functions make asynchronous code look more like synchronous code, improving readability and reducing the mental overhead of managing callbacks or chaining `.then()`.

2. **Error Handling**: `try...catch` blocks can be used to handle errors in a straightforward manner, similar to synchronous code.

3. **Sequential Execution**: Async functions allow for sequential execution of asynchronous tasks, ensuring operations are performed in a predictable order.

### When to Use Async and Await

- **Fetching Data**: When making HTTP requests or fetching data from APIs, `fetch` API combined with async/await simplifies the process.
  
- **Handling Promises**: When dealing with multiple Promises and needing to wait for one to complete before starting another operation.

- **Processing Files**: When reading or writing files asynchronously.

- **Any Asynchronous Operation**: Any operation that involves waiting for something to complete, such as timeouts, database queries, or complex calculations that can benefit from non-blocking execution.

### Considerations

- **Support**: Ensure the environment supports async/await (modern browsers, Node.js versions 8 and above).
  
- **Compatibility**: If targeting older environments, consider transpiling async/await code using tools like Babel.

### Conclusion

Async functions and await expressions provide a cleaner and more maintainable way to write asynchronous JavaScript code compared to traditional Promise-based or callback-based approaches. They improve code readability, simplify error handling, and make it easier to reason about complex asynchronous workflows. As a developer, understanding how and when to use async/await can significantly enhance your ability to write efficient and maintainable JavaScript applications.
