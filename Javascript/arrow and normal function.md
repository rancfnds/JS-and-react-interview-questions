Arrow functions (`=>`) and normal functions (`function`) in JavaScript have several differences in terms of syntax, behavior, and usage. These differences affect how they handle scope, `this` binding, and how they are generally used in JavaScript programming.

### Syntax Differences

1. **Arrow Function Syntax:**

   ```javascript
   const add = (a, b) => {
     return a + b;
   };
   ```

   - Arrow functions use a concise syntax with `=>`.
   - If the function body consists of a single expression, you can omit the curly braces `{}` and the `return` keyword (implicit return).

2. **Normal Function Syntax:**

   ```javascript
   function add(a, b) {
     return a + b;
   }
   ```

   - Normal functions use the `function` keyword to define the function.
   - Requires explicit use of `return` to return a value.

### `this` Binding

- **Arrow Functions:**
  - Lexical `this`: Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context. They inherit `this` from the enclosing lexical context (the scope in which they are defined).
  - Useful when you want to preserve the `this` context from the surrounding code.

- **Normal Functions:**
  - Dynamic `this`: The value of `this` is determined by how the function is called.
  - `this` is determined at runtime based on the object that invokes the function.

### Arguments Object

- **Arrow Functions:**
  - Arrow functions do not have an `arguments` object. Instead, you can use rest parameters (`...args`) to gather arguments into an array.

- **Normal Functions:**
  - Normal functions have an `arguments` object which is an array-like object holding all arguments passed to the function.

### Usage and Considerations

- **Arrow Functions:**
  - Preferred for non-method functions (functions not bound to an object).
  - Useful for concise one-liners or callbacks.
  - Not suitable for methods (`this` binding may not behave as expected in methods).

- **Normal Functions:**
  - More flexible with `this` binding (suitable for methods and constructors).
  - Can use `arguments` object.
  - Traditional and more familiar syntax for many developers.

### Example Use Cases

**Arrow Function:**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

// Using arrow function with array method
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

**Normal Function:**
```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;

  // Normal function used as a method
  this.sayHello = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  };
}

const alice = new Person('Alice');
alice.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice.
```

### Summary

- **Arrow Functions:** Use arrow functions for concise and lexical `this` binding. They are ideal for short functions and non-method functions.
- **Normal Functions:** Use normal functions when you need dynamic `this` binding or when you require access to the `arguments` object. They are suitable for methods and constructors.

Understanding these differences helps in choosing the appropriate type of function based on the specific requirements of your code and the behavior you expect from `this` binding and argument handling.
