Sure, here are some common interview questions related to JavaScript that you might encounter in a 30-minute interview for a React.js developer intern role:

1. *Basic JavaScript Concepts*:
   - What is the difference between var, let, and const?
   - Explain hoisting in JavaScript.
   - What are closures and how are they used?
   - Describe the differences between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript.

2. *ES6 Features*:
   - What are arrow functions? How are they different from regular functions?
   - Explain the use cases for let and const compared to var.
   - What are template literals and how do you use them?
   - Describe destructuring in JavaScript and provide an example.

3. *Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript*:
   - What is prototypal inheritance? How does it differ from classical inheritance?
   - Explain how this works in JavaScript.
   - What are classes in JavaScript? How do they differ from constructor functions?

4. *DOM Manipulation and Events*:
   - How do you select elements in the DOM using JavaScript?
   - Explain event delegation and why it is useful.
   - What are event listeners? Provide an example of attaching an event listener to a DOM element.

5. *Asynchronous JavaScript*:
   - What are Promises in JavaScript? How do they help in handling asynchronous operations?
   - Explain async and await in JavaScript. When would you use them?
   - How do you handle errors in asynchronous JavaScript code?

6. *React.js Specific Questions* (since it's a React.js developer intern role):
   - What are components in React? How do you create a functional component?
   - Explain the concept of props in React. How do you pass data from a parent component to a child component?
   - What are stateful and stateless components in React? When would you use each one?
   - Describe the React component lifecycle methods. When would you use componentDidMount()?

7. *General Problem-Solving*:
   - Given an array of numbers, write a function to find the maximum value.
   - Implement a function that reverses a string without using built-in methods.
   - Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

These questions cover a range of topics from basic JavaScript concepts to more specific React.js-related questions. Practice explaining these concepts clearly and concisely, and consider how you would approach solving coding problems related to JavaScript and React.js. Good luck with your interview preparation!
